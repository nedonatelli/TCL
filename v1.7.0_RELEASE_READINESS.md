## Known Limitations & Phase 19 Roadmap

### Current Limitations
1. **Network Flow Performance:** Bellman-Ford solver is O(VE²) complexity
   - Suitable for small problems (<100×100)
   - Phase 19: Will implement network simplex algorithm

2. **Performance Tests Skipped:** 13 network flow tests skipped for optimization
   - Will be re-enabled in Phase 19 after solver optimization
   - Expected speedup: 5-10x

### Phase 19 Planning
- Network flow solver optimization (network simplex)
- Numba/Cython acceleration for critical paths
- Parallel processing support
- Performance profiling and optimization
