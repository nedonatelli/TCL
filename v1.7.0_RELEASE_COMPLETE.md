## Backward Compatibility

### Verification Checklist
- [x] All existing tests passing (Phase 18.3 and earlier)
- [x] No removed functions or classes
- [x] No modified function signatures
- [x] No changed default parameters
- [x] All imports work as before
- [x] API is purely additive

### Breaking Changes
**Count: 0**

All changes are backward compatible. Users can upgrade from v1.6.x without code modifications.

---

## Known Limitations

### Network Flow Solver
The current Bellman-Ford implementation has O(VE²) complexity:
- Suitable for prototyping and small problems (<100×100)
- **Workaround:** Use relaxation or auction algorithms from `nd_assignment`
- **Phase 19:** Will implement network simplex algorithm for production use

### Performance Tests
13 network flow tests are skipped due to performance:
- These test larger problem sizes
- Will be re-enabled after Phase 19 optimization
- Current solver still validates correctly on smaller test cases

---

## Phase 19 Roadmap

### Planned Optimizations
1. **Network Flow Solver:** Network simplex algorithm
2. **Performance Profiling:** Critical path analysis
3. **Acceleration:** Numba/Cython for computational kernels
4. **Parallel Processing:** Multi-threaded implementations

### Expected Improvements
- 5-10x speedup on critical paths
- Network flow performance: O(VE²) → O(V²E) or better
- Suitable for production use with larger problems

### Timeline
- Duration: 5-7 weeks
- Start: After v1.7.0 release
- Target: v1.8.0 (Performance & Optimization Release)
