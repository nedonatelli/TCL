# Git LFS tracking for generated HTML files (interactive visualizations)
# These are tracked with LFS to prevent repository bloating while allowing
# visualization files to be committed. Regenerate with:
#   python scripts/generate_example_plots.py
docs/_static/images/examples/*.html filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# Exclude problematic large files that caused Git LFS issues
# terrain_demo.html was 4.2GB and should be generated locally if needed
# docs/_static/images/examples/terrain_demo.html should not be committed
