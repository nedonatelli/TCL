"""
Dynamic motion models for target tracking.

This module provides state transition matrices (F) and process noise
covariance matrices (Q) for various motion models:
- Constant velocity
- Constant acceleration  
- Coordinated turn (2D and 3D)
- Singer acceleration model
- Nearly constant velocity/acceleration
